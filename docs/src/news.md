Release notes for BVDOutbreakSize.
Major versions of the report are kept as
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/epiforecasts/BVDOutbreakSize/releases);
each push to `main` also republishes the rendered analysis and the
`output/` artifacts.

## v1.6.0

Changes since v1.5.0.

### Model

- Added an isolation/treatment-bed occupancy stream ("Patients en
  isolement"), the renewal analogue of EpiNow2's `estimate_secondary`
  prevalence model.
  The daily bed occupancy is a STOCK, fitted as the suspect inflow carried
  through a length-of-stay survival rather than a cumulative sum: the
  ascertained BVD inflow with a long sampled treatment stay plus the non-BVD
  background inflow with a short fixed rule-out stay, so the bed occupancy is
  a BVD/background mixture (dominated by the BVD-treatment component) whose
  level and lag inform the admission fraction and the treatment stay.
  Added `convolve_survival` (the prevalence analogue of `convolve_delay`),
  the `treatment_admission_model` observation submodel, the
  `isolation_admission_model` prior and the `treatment_only_model`
  single-stream composer.

### Data

- Added the daily "Patients en isolement" occupancy for 1-11 June (SitReps
  018-028) as a structured `patients_isolated` column and the
  `[isolation_history]` manifest block.
  The fitted series begins 1 June where the all-patients column definition
  is stable; the narrower suspects-only count in SitReps 016-017 is a
  different quantity and is excluded.
  Corrected the SitRep 020 note (the PDF headline occupancy is 233, not the
  173 the note claimed).

## v1.5.0

Changes since v1.4.0.

### Model

- Confirmed deaths now carry the report-to-receipt laboratory delay, so the
  laboratory-confirmed-death series lags the death event rather than tracking
  it instantaneously and the confirmed case and death streams pay a consistent
  laboratory delay.
- Added an optional daily new-suspect inflow stream ("nouveaux cas suspects
  du jour") to the suspected-case likelihood.
  The post-26 May per-day counts are scored against the modelled daily
  suspected series at each report day, continuing the suspected signal where
  the frozen cumulative series stops, on days disjoint from it (#222).
- Collapsed the laboratory pipeline onto a single suspected-to-analysed
  volume, fit to the specimens-analysed series through one report-to-analysed
  delay.
  The received stream is still recorded but no longer fitted, and the
  post-cut-off 24-hour analysed volume is now fit directly.
- Late reporting windows, where the cumulative national analysed denominator
  stops, are scored in one submodel.
  A day with a published 24-hour analysed count anchors its positivity as a
  binomial on that count, and the remaining days are scored against the
  modelled laboratory volume.
  These are a reporting-format change rather than data blackouts, so the
  earlier "dark window" framing is dropped.
- Added the delay-corrected confirmed case-fatality ratio, the Nishiura et al.
  (2009) real-time correction computed per posterior draw on the modelled
  confirmed trajectory and sampled confirmation-to-death delay.
  The denominator shrinks from all confirmed cases to those expected to have
  had a fatal outcome resolve by the cut-off, debiasing the naive confirmed
  ratio.

### Forecast

- The one-week-ahead forecast and its validation now target the
  laboratory-confirmed case and confirmed death streams.
  The suspected reported cases and deaths are no longer published, so they no
  longer serve as forecast targets or as the last-week-versus-now comparison.

### Report

- Added a confirmed case-fatality ratio section, setting the delay-corrected
  confirmed CFR against the structural infection-based CFR and the naive
  confirmed ratio, with a comparison table and posterior-density plot.
- The estimate-evolution figure now draws each release as a discrete per-fit
  estimate with nested 30/60/90% intervals, read from
  `data/released_estimates.csv` rather than a hand-maintained literal.
  Frozen renewal re-fits are restricted to the integral-era release cut-offs,
  since renewal-era releases already are renewal fits.
  A new `scripts/refresh_releases.jl` pulls the per-release estimates from the
  tagged results releases.

### Data

- Captured the daily new-suspect counts (SitReps 021-024, 4-7 June) as a
  structured `new_daily_suspects` column in the scanned situation-report CSV
  and a `suspected_daily_history` block in the observation manifest.
- Extended the confirmed case and death series to SitRep 025 (8 June).
- Added the trusted-day 24-hour analysed laboratory counts (1, 4-7 June) as a
  `tests_analysed_daily_history` block to anchor late-window positivity.

## v1.4.0

The methods switch flagged in v1.3.0: the continuous-time, fixed-growth-rate
model is replaced by a discrete-time renewal model that is simpler and avoids
the single-stream-versus-joint size tension of issue #212.
This is a substantial revision; the changes below are relative to v1.3.0.

### Model

- Replaced the integral exponential-growth model with a discrete-time renewal
  process on a daily grid.
  Infections follow the renewal equation under a time-varying reproduction
  number (a weekly log-scale random walk with an intervention ramp), and every
  observed stream sits downstream of latent onsets through its own sampled,
  discretised delay.
- The prior is placed on the growth rate (the molecular-clock doubling time)
  and the first reproduction number is derived forward through Euler–Lotka.
  The generation interval is a Gamma with shape and scale taken from the cited
  source and its reported uncertainty.
- The onset-to-event delays are taken from a Bayesian reanalysis of the 2012
  Isiro line list on their natural Gamma parameters, with one onset-to-
  admission delay serving both suspected-case reporting and export detection
  and onset-to-death the convolution of two atomic components.
- Two-phase seeding: a single import grows through an unobserved cryptic
  exponential phase to the renewal start, with the outbreak age bounded by the
  genetic time to the most recent common ancestor.
- Confirmed positivity is tied to the suspect-pool composition through an assay
  sensitivity and specificity, and exports are travel-gated from infection and
  scored on their dated detection days.
- The DRC streams are fitted on the incidence scale, as the between-vintage
  increments across successive situation reports (the first vintage being the
  cumulative count to that date).

### Report

The report was rebuilt around the renewal model; the analyses carried over
from v1.3.0 (the one-week-ahead forecast and its validation, the
no-onward-transmission counterfactual, the delay and clock-rate sensitivity
analyses, and the McCabe et al. comparison) were re-implemented for the new
model rather than added here.

- Restructured the methods in generative order (infections, epidemiological
  processes, observation models, the joint model) with the model maths given
  explicitly.
- Reworked the figures (reproduction number with credible ribbons and sampled
  trajectories, cumulative infections, onsets and deaths, outbreak size by data
  stream, and estimate evolution across releases).
- The McCabe et al. scenario comparison now carries their reported 95%
  confidence intervals.
- The one-week-ahead forecast and its last-week-versus-now validation now
  target the laboratory-confirmed cases and confirmed deaths. The suspected
  reported cases and deaths are no longer reported, so they are dropped as
  forecast targets.

### Data

- Advanced the cut-off to 7 June 2026 (SitRep 024).
  The laboratory-confirmed streams run to the cut-off while the suspected
  streams stay frozen at their 26 May values.

## v1.3.0

!!! warning "Final release of this model formulation"

    This is the last planned release of the continuous-time,
    fixed-growth-rate model. The laboratory and testing observation
    model has outgrown the available data, and the joint fit now implies
    a larger outbreak than any single data stream does on its own
    (issue #212). We are replacing this model with a discrete-time
    renewal model, which is simpler and avoids these problems, in a
    follow-up release that will note the methods switch. Treat the
    estimates here as provisional.

Changes since v1.2.0.

### Data

- Advanced the model cut-off to 28 May 2026 and switched the DRC streams
  to the INSP national cumulative totals read from the situation-report
  PDFs, rather than the per-zone CSVs whose zone sums drop cases not yet
  attributed to a zone. The suspected streams are frozen at their 26 May
  values, after which INSP stopped publishing a national suspected total;
  the confirmed and laboratory streams run to 28 May.
- Added per-sitrep-vintage confirmed cases, confirmed deaths and
  laboratory throughput (samples received and analysed) to
  `data/observations.toml`, alongside the suspected cases and deaths.
- Extended the observed series through 5 June 2026 to validate the
  forecast out of sample.

### Modelling

- The joint model now fits four DRC streams per sitrep vintage (suspected
  cases, suspected deaths, laboratory-confirmed cases and
  laboratory-confirmed deaths) by conditioning on the between-vintage
  increments, alongside the Uganda exports and export deaths. A
  single-vintage stream reduces to the cumulative likelihood.
- Confirmed cases are fitted through a laboratory-throughput queue:
  suspects enter a received backlog after a report-to-receipt delay, a
  capacity-limited drain sets the samples analysed, and the new positives
  in each window are a Binomial on the samples newly analysed. Windows
  with no published analysed count fall back to the queue's expected
  throughput, so no free per-window denominator is introduced.
- Test positivity is severity-first: early specimens skew toward severe
  presentations and relax toward the latent case composition as analysed
  volume accrues.
- Suspected cases and deaths are BVD onset-to-report convolutions plus
  additive non-BVD background rates; confirmed deaths share the case-lab
  PCR sensitivity and specificity.
- Split ascertainment into independent DRC and Uganda reporting fractions
  (DRC centre 0.75), and recentred the growth prior on the molecular-clock
  20-day doubling time ([cuomodannenburg2026](@cite)).
- Exports and export deaths are timed from infection via an
  infection→detection delay convolution rather than a rectangular
  detection window, reducing to the McCabe et al. window as the delay
  collapses to a point mass.
- The headline estimand is cumulative infections (`2^m`), with the
  under-ascertainment multiplier anchored on the laboratory-confirmed
  cases.

### Outputs

- Posterior summary table, a laboratory-pipeline pair plot, and
  posterior-predictive panels for the confirmed-case and confirmed-death
  streams in the per-stream-versus-joint grid.
- Recast the forecast around the four trusted quantities (infections,
  true BVD deaths, confirmed cases, confirmed deaths) over a
  one-week-ahead and a counterfactual-year horizon, dropping the
  untrusted suspected and tests-analysed streams.
- Restored the forecast validation as a last-week-vs-now out-of-sample
  check: fit the joint through 28 May, forecast forward, and score the
  predicted confirmed cases and deaths against the observed counts.
- Added a conditional one-step-ahead predictive across the sitrep series,
  each vintage predicting only its new increment.

### Documentation

- Surfaced the delay priors as equations, clarified that the latent pool
  is the true-case count rather than the tested or confirmed count, and
  added limitations on the constant-growth assumption and on per-sitrep
  increments mixing incidence with backfill.

### Infrastructure

- Added streaming progress to `nuts_sample` via an optional callback
  (a dependency-free file stream or TensorBoard), and optional Enzyme
  reverse-mode AD alongside the default Mooncake backend.

## v1.2.0

### Modelling

- Improved the comparison to the McCabe et al. report by making sure that 95% credible intervals are being compared and reordering it.
- Added a custom chain rule for `SpecialFunctions.gamma_inc`. This allows us to differentiate through the analytical solution to the gamma convolution integral.

### Data

- Moved the cut-off to 23 May 2026 and switched the DRC source from
  the WHO AFRO joint sitrep to the situation reports of the Institut
  National de Santé Publique (INSP), transcribed by
  [INRB-UMIE/Ebola_DRC_2026](https://github.com/INRB-UMIE/Ebola_DRC_2026).
  The INSP series gives a per-zone, per-sitrep daily vintage trajectory
  (suspected and confirmed; this analysis uses suspected). Cumulative
  counts at 23 May: 905 suspected DRC cases, 220 suspected DRC deaths,
  across the 12 reporting health zones. The 18 May INSP vintage (516
  cases, 131 deaths) matches the WHO joint sitrep 01 total exactly.
- Updated Uganda to three travel-related imports with one death,
  reflecting the third import announced on 23 May 2026 (woman from DRC
  who travelled Arua to Entebbe to Kampala; tested positive on
  follow-up). Two further Uganda-confirmed cases announced the same
  day (a driver and a healthcare worker) are domestic contacts of the
  first import and are excluded from `exported_cases` because the
  model treats Uganda as imports only.
- Added a `reported_case_history` block in `data/observations.toml`
  with eight INSP sitrep vintages (14 May to 23 May 2026), ready for
  the cumulative-trajectory likelihood once it merges.

### Infrastructure

- Moved the submodels out of the analysis file and into the supporting package. Instead we now print these in the analysis.
- Added additional package infrastructure including `Aqua.jl` and `Jet.jl`.
- Streamlined the package unit tests.

## v1.1.0

### Modelling

- Bound the seeding time `T` from below with a soft prior on the
  genetic time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA), following a
  suggestion from Neil Ferguson to combine the genetic signal with the
  other data streams as a seeding bound.
- Switched the export deaths to a daily (time-resolved binned) Poisson
  process: a continuous survival weight for the no-death stretch before
  the first dated death, then a per-day Poisson from that day to the
  cut-off.
- Bound `T` with export-death timing through that survival weight, and
  with case-export detection timing through a first-export-detection
  survival term on the Uganda admission date. Dates supplied in
  `data/observations.toml`.
- Death-convolution quadrature adapted to the sampled delay scale.
- Added a clock-rate sensitivity: refit the joint model under the
  faster 1.9e-3 early-epidemic TMRCA estimate and compare the impact on
  outbreak size, seeding time and growth rate against the 1.2e-3
  baseline.
- Sped up the deaths-among-exports likelihood: precompute the
  onset-to-death CDF once and reuse it across bin edges
  (`ExportDeathDelay`), replacing the per-node nested quadrature.
- Removed hardcoded death and case constants that diverged from the
  observations in `data/observations.toml`.
- Added a forecast validation: fit the joint model to the original
  report's data, project it forward to the current cut-off, and compare
  the predicted cumulative and new counts per stream against the counts
  observed since, as a table and a 2×3 coverage plot.

### Data

- Updated to the McCabe et al. 20 May 2026 report, comparing both
  report versions.
- Sourced the genetic TMRCA seeding bound from the BEAST temporal-tree
  estimate in the 2026-05-21
  [virological.org](https://virological.org/t/initial-genomes-from-may-2026-bundibugyo-virus-disease-outbreak-in-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-and-uganda/1032)
  update (mean 2026-03-25, 95% HPD 2026-02-20 to 2026-04-20, at the
  1.2e-3 EBOV clock rate this analysis assumes).

### Infrastructure

- Dropped MCMCChains for FlexiChains and prepared for registry
  release.
- CI docs preview PR comments and version-bump automation.

### Docs

- Added a scope note to the README and analysis report framing the
  work as an external view built on our understanding of real-time
  infectious disease dynamics, and inviting feedback, reuse and
  adaptation.
- Surfaced results from the README and analysis landing page, added
  stable and dev docs badges.
- Plotting and labelling fixes: surveillance dispersion on the 1/√k
  scale, predictive histograms labelled as frequency, and coarser
  (four-weekly) start-date axis ticks so the labels stay readable.
- Reworked the headline summary to report the credible intervals as
  sentences rather than leading with a median, defined the prior-IQR
  shift, and explained the reported-case scaling in terms of the DRC
  reporting fraction with a link to the pair plot.
- Replaced the model-structure diagram with a parameter-to-observation
  table.
- Culled promotional register in the analysis report.

## v1.0.0

First release.
A joint Bayesian re-analysis of the McCabe et al. report that fits all
data streams together in a single Turing model over the latent
cumulative case count.

- Conditions on the exported cases and DRC deaths the report uses,
  plus reported DRC cases (with an ascertainment component) and deaths
  among exported cases.
- Adds a no-onward-transmission projected-deaths counterfactual, a
  one-week-ahead forecast of newly reported cases, deaths and exports,
  and an onset-to-death delay sensitivity analysis.
- Replaces the deaths-convolution and small-growth-rate exports
  closed-form approximations with their exact forms.
- Maths-first analysis page with code folded behind dropdowns and a
  diagram of the model build-up.
- Compares against a joint reimplementation of the report's approach
  and its original published estimates.
